## Project: SWEe!

SWEe! is a desktop application used for managing CS2103T learning progress mainly through flashcards. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=tanzhuoyao-nus)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Refactor AddCommandParserTest and ParserUtilTest classes to support the testing of adding of flashcards
  [#29](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/29)
  * Refactor ListCommand and ListCommandTest classes to list out all the flashcards
  [#39](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/39)
  * Add FilterCommand to filter for flashcards
  [#41](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/41/files) &
  [#97](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/97/files)
    * What it does: Allows the user to filter for flashcards according to category, rating and/or favourites status
    * Justification: This allows the user to toggle through the flashcard deck to display flashcards of specific
    requirements to aid navigability and ease for revision during quiz mode
    * Highlights: I have implemented the "and search" function to allow users to specify more than one filter attribute
    specification
  * Add test cases for FilterCommand under FilterCommandTest
  [#45](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/45)
  * Refactor FindCommand and FindCommandTest classes to support finding of flashcards
  [#57](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/57/files)
  * Add tag feature in flashcards to support up to multiple tags on a flashcard
  [#88](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/88)
  * Refactor LogicManagerTest, FilterCommandTest, FlashcardDeckParserTest,
  ModelManagerTest to ensure remaining test cases fully support the application
