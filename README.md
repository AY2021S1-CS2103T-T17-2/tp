* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _SWEe!_) used for managing CS2103T learning progress mainly through flashcards.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `SWEe!` (`Software Engineering Everyday!`).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SWEe! Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-t17-2.github.io/tp/)**.
